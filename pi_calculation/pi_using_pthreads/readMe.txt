This exercise consists of:
1. A serial computation (estimate) of pi.
2. A parallel computation of pi using pthreads.
Both of them are using Mode-Carlo technic.

From this program can be cucluded that increasing the number of throws, leads to achieve better approximation of pi. Also with threads it is obvious that the time that
required is much smaller. Even when we double the number of threads
for the same number of throws the time is almost halved compared to serial.
